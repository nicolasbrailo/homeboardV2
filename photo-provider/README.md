# photo-provider

Bridges a remote [wwwslide](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/wwwslide) HTTP photo server with local D-Bus consumers. Registers as a client with the server, pre-fetches a small ring of JPEGs into `memfd`s, and hands them out one at a time over D-Bus (passing the fd directly). Target size and QR-embed flag can be changed at runtime over D-Bus; any change triggers a fresh server-side registration and flushes the cache.

```
photo-provider <config.json>
```

Runs until `SIGTERM` / `SIGINT`. Intended to run as a systemd service.

## D-Bus interface

Service `io.homeboard.PhotoProvider`, object `/io/homeboard/PhotoProvider`, interface `io.homeboard.PhotoProvider1`:

| Method | Signature | Effect |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| `GetPhoto` | `() → (h, s)` | Returns `(fd, metadata_json)` for the next cached photo. Fd is a sealed `memfd`; caller closes. Blocks up to 30s if cache is empty. |
| `SetTargetSize` | `(uu) → ()` | Updates `(w, h)`, re-registers with server, flushes cache. |
| `SetEmbedQr` | `(b) → ()` | Toggles QR embed, re-registers, flushes. |

## Config

JSON file; see `config.json` for an example.

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `server_url` | wwwslide base URL (no trailing slash) |
| `target_size_w` / `target_size_h` | Requested render size (128..3840) |
| `embed_qr` | Ask server to burn a QR code into the image |
| `cache_depth` | Ring size; worker keeps this many photos pre-fetched |
| `dump_to_disk` / `dump_dir` | If true, also write each fetched image as `N.jpeg` into `dump_dir` |
| `connect_timeout_s` / `request_timeout_s` | libcurl timeouts for all HTTP calls |

## Install

```
sudo make install_sysroot_deps   # json-c, libsystemd, libcurl + openldap
make
make deploy
make deploy-config
make deploy-dbus-policy          # one-time; reloads dbus
```

## Source files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `main.c` | Entry point, lifecycle wiring |
| `config.c` | json-c config loader |
| `www_session.c` | libcurl HTTP client; owns `client_id`, target size, embed_qr; handles (re-)registration |
| `cache.c` | Worker thread + ring of `{fd, meta}`; generation counter for invalidation |
| `dbus.c` | sd-bus vtable for the methods above |

## Notes for LLMs working in this directory

**Architecture: three layers, bottom-up ownership.**

- `www_session` is the lowest layer: pure HTTP, no threads of its own. Owns two `CURL *` handles — `curl_fetch` (used by the cache worker thread) and `curl_ctrl` (used by the dbus thread for setters). They are separate so a slow image fetch does not block a config change or vice versa; libcurl easy handles are not thread-safe, so sharing one would require a mutex across the whole fetch.
- `cache` sits above `www_session`. It owns the worker thread, the ring, a mutex+condvar, and a generation counter. It borrows the `www_session *` (does not own it).
- `dbus` sits above both. Method handlers call into `cache` (for `GetPhoto`) or `www_session` (for setters). The dbus layer owns nothing but the sd-bus slot/connection.

**Two-phase init on `www_session`.** `pp_www_session_init` sets up the struct and CURL handles but does not touch the network. `pp_www_session_start` performs the initial `/client_register` and installs the invalidate callback. This split exists to break the bootstrap cycle: `cache` needs a `www_session *`, and `www_session`'s invalidate callback needs to point into `cache`. Order in `main.c`: ws_init → cache_init → ws_start(cb=pp_cache_invalidate, ud=cache).

**Invalidation via generation counter.** When a setter fires, `www_session` does `/client_register`, pushes config, installs the new id, and invokes the invalidate callback. `cache_invalidate` bumps a `uint64_t` generation under the cache mutex and drains the ring. The worker captures `gen` before each fetch and, on push, discards the result if the current gen no longer matches — this is the only mechanism that protects against "worker fetched with the old client_id and finished after the re-register."

**Atomics for the mutable config.** `target_w`, `target_h`, `embed_qr` in `www_session` are `atomic_uint` / `atomic_bool`. Setters use `atomic_exchange` to detect no-op writes. No mutex needed because these are only *read* inside `reregister`, where the new register call defines ordering against the server; there is no invariant between `target_w` and `target_h` that an intermediate read could violate. **Do not** add a mutex around these.

**`client_id` uses a mutex.** It's a string (longer than any atomic), and the fetch path needs a stable snapshot during one HTTP call. The pattern in `fetch_next`: lock, copy into a local buffer, unlock, then do IO with the local copy.

**Timeouts.** Both timeouts live in config and are applied on every `curl_easy_setopt` call (we `curl_easy_reset` per request). Worst-case shutdown latency is `request_timeout_s` for an in-flight fetch plus the 30s `GetPhoto` dbus-side wait; current config gives ~90s. sd-bus dispatch is single-threaded so there's no in-flight method handler at teardown — see the shutdown-safety discussion in git history if touching `pp_dbus_free`.

**Meta-fetch fallback.** If `/get_current_img_meta` fails but the image fetch succeeded, we serve the image with `"{}"` metadata rather than discarding it. The image is the expensive/important part.

**Build and deploy are driven by the user.** Do not run `make`, `make deploy`, or `apt install`/`add_sysroot_pkg.sh` yourself — propose changes, let the user run them, and wait for output.
