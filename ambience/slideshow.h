// and before it's blitted to the scanout framebuffer. The callback may draw
// overlays (text, icons, ...) directly into `buf`. `buf` is in screen
// coordinates (image rotation is already applied) with XRGB8888 layout, sized
// `height * stride` bytes. `rot` is the screen rotation — use it if the
// overlay content needs its own orientation.
//
// The callback runs on the slideshow worker thread, not the dbus dispatch
// thread. If it reads state owned elsewhere (e.g. a dbus-updated string), the
// caller is responsible for synchronization.
// TODO: Refactor so that main drives the render loop, instead of having the slideshow provide a cb
